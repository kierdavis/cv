    Aug 2016 &
    Volunteered with running the annual Computing and Microelectronics summer school at the university, where 14--15 year olds completed a team engineering project while receiving support from experts. Currently I am working on hardware development and general planning for the next one, which will take place in August 2017.

    Jan 2016 &
    Built and tested a boost converter power supply for a design exercise as part of my degree course. The project involved running detailed simulations of the circuit, constructing the circuit on a protoboard, writing embedded control software in \texttt{C}, and testing and tuning the circuit to produce optimal results.

    Aug 2015 &
    Began working on a hobby project to build a minimal working 8-bit processor out of discrete logic ICs, as inspired by a number of similar projects that I have come across online.

    Apr 2015 &
    Competed in the 2015 Student Robotics competition as part of a team of approximately eight people from my school, in which we were required to design and build an autonomous robot capable of playing a game of Capture the Flag. Despite having to overcome a number of challenges during the development of the robot, we managed to reach the semi-finals of the competition and place sixth out of fifty teams overall.

    Aug 2012 &
    Participated in the Young Rewired State week-long hackathon, where we built a web application utilising open government data. My team and I came first in the \emph{Best Example of Coding} category and won a 3D printer, which we then spent a few months building.
    \vspace{1.2em} \\

    %Jul 2012 &
    %Developed a software library for manipulating RDF, a structured format for open data. This project used the Go programming language, and its source code is available on Github.
