    Jan 2016 &
    Built and tested a boost converter power supply for a design exercise as part of my degree course. The project involved running detailed simulations of the circuit, constructing the circuit on a protoboard, writing embedded control software in \texttt{C}, and testing and tuning the circuit to produce optimal results.

    Aug 2015 &
    Began working on a hobby project to build a small working 8-bit processor out of discrete logic ICs, as inspired by a number of similar projects that I have found online. The hardware designs and software code are open source and are available online at \url{https://github.com/kierdavis/k12}.

    Apr 2015 &
    Competed in the 2015 Student Robotics competition as part of a team of around 8 people from my school, in which we were required to design and build an autonomous robot capable of playing a game of Capture the Flag. Despite having to overcome a number of challenges during the development of the robot, we managed to reach the semi-finals of the competition and place sixth overall.
