\heading{Interests}

\begin{itemize}
  \item I enjoy playing card, board and video games and regularly attend gaming socials organised by societies at my University.
  \item Having participated in the Student Robotics competition in 2015, I now frequently volunteer with running the competition and its associated events, as well as mentoring one of the teams. I am now also involved in the organisation and hardware development for an electronics summer school.
  \item I have worked on a number of small software and electronics projects at home, mainly for my own enjoyment. These include writing scripts to automate some of my day-to-day tasks, contributing to open-source projects (primarily the NixOS operating system). and implementing simple CPU designs on my FPGA board.
  \item I am currently teaching myself to cook.
