\heading{Interests}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Having participated in the \studentrobotics{} competition in 2015, I now volunteer with running the competition and its associated events, as well as mentoring some of the teams and contributing to development of the robotics kit.
  \item I have worked on a number of software and electronics projects at home, mainly for my own enjoyment and learning. These include writing scripts to automate some of my day-to-day tasks, contributing to open-source projects (primarily the NixOS operating system), and implementing simple CPU designs on my FPGA board.
  \item I enjoy playing board games and video games and regularly attend gaming socials organised by societies at my university.
