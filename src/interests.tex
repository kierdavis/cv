\heading{Interests}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Having participated in the \studentrobotics{} competition in 2015, I now volunteer with running the competition and its associated events, as well as mentoring some of the teams and contributing to development of the robotics kit.
  \item I have worked on a few software and electronics projects at home, mainly for my own enjoyment and learning. These include developing an application to organise my music library, writing scripts to automate some of my day-to-day tasks, contributing to open-source projects (primarily the NixOS operating system) and building a simple CPU out of discrete logic chips.
  %\item I help organise Gendershake, a series of social events with the aim of enabling LGBTQ\+ individuals to overcome isolation and connect with likeminded people.
  \item I enjoy modelling, hiking, reading sci-fi, experimenting with 3D printing and playing board and video games.
