\heading{Interests}

\begin{itemize}
\item I enjoy playing card, board and video games and regularly attend gaming socials organised by societies at my University.
\item After participating as a competitor in Student Robotics last year, I am now volunteering to assist running this year's competition. I helped out with the Kickstart event in early November and am hoping to get involved with hardware development.
\item I have worked on a number of small software and electronics projects at home, mainly for my own enjoyment. These include simple applications for my FPGA board, utility scripts that I use day-to-day on my computer and server plugins for the online sandbox game \emph{Minecraft}.
\item I am currently teaching myself to cook.
