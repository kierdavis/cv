\heading{About me}

I have recently completed my A-levels and have just started my first year studying Electronic Engineering at the \mbox{University of Southampton}. I have been programming for nearly half of my life and whilst I have explored a wide range of programming languages and technologies I continue to enjoy applying them to solve new problems. I love to learn, but I feel most rewarded when I am able to help others to learn as well. I can work independently and diligently, and can quickly grasp new concepts. I aim to contribute usefully and meaningfully to any team or business I work with and to do so with a friendly and enthusiastic attitude.
