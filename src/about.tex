\heading{About me}

I am currently in my second year of studying \courseshort{} at the \university{}. I have been programming computers since an early age, and having explored a wide range of technologies I continue to enjoy applying them to solve new problems. I love to learn, but I feel most rewarded when I am able to help others to learn as well. I can work independently and diligently, and can quickly grasp new concepts. I aim to contribute usefully and meaningfully to any team or business I work with and to do so with a friendly and enthusiastic attitude.
